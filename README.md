# K-Means Clustering & Neural Networks in .NET For a specific dataset
* This project is the practical application of the K-Means clustering algorithm and multilayer artificial neural networks on .NET Core 7 that I learned in the "Machine Learning" course.
* Microsoft ML.NET library was used for the K-Means algorithm, and Accord.Neuro library was used to create the Artificial Neural network model.
# Functions:
* /createKMeans
  Runs the algorithm according to the desired "k" (total number of clusters), calculates the predicted cluster for each data record, and overall performance scores (WCSS, BCSS, Dunn Index)
